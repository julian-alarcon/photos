 bio: "Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer who loves open source software culture!
I enjoy learning from new cultures and I try to experience one new thing every day as when I
drove in one of the dangerous ways in South America (I'm not doing it again... ever)

A coffee lover from a coffee country, an amateur photographer and a great conversationalist, especially when beer is involved!"
